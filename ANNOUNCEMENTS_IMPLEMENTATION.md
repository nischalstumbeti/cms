## Usage Instructions

### For Administrators

   - Remove uploaded files before saving if needed

### Database Setup
1. Run the migration script in Supabase SQL editor:
   ```sql

   ```

2. The system will automatically create:
   - Announcements table
   - Required indexes
   - RLS policies
   - Sample announcements

## Technical Details

### File Storage
- Files are stored in `/public/uploads/` directory
- Unique filenames generated using timestamp + original name
- File validation on both client and server side

### Security
- File type validation
- File size limits
- SQL injection protection through parameterized queries
- XSS protection through proper input sanitization

### Performance
- Database indexes on frequently queried fields
- Efficient pagination support
- Optimized file upload handling

## Future Enhancements
- Bulk operations (delete multiple, activate/deactivate multiple)
- Announcement categories/tags
- Scheduled announcements
- Email notifications for new announcements
- Rich text editor for content
- Image previews for uploaded images
- Announcement templates
- Analytics for announcement views

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files
- `announcements-table-migration.sql` - Database migration
- `src/app/api/announcements/route.ts` - Main announcements API
- `src/app/api/announcements/[id]/route.ts` - Individual announcement API
